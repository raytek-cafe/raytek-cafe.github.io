            <p>
              After a brief intermission, raytek.cafe is back up and running
              again! The trolls tried to demean our great work and slander our
              developers, but our community stands undefeated. We caught the
              losers off guard, and made such <i>tremendous</i> progress with
              our projects that they will never be able to compete. Thank you to
              all those who stood by and were with us this whole time.
            </p>
            <h2>setting things straight</h2>
            <p>
              I apologize for not speaking out sooner, but with so much going on
              in real life, I had to take a break from the internet and focus on
              more important things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Those who know me well know that the slanderous lies those sick
              and vile people were spreading are completely false. I didn't care
              enough about the drama to keep using my main account, though the
              plan was to eventually confront online community heads to clear my
              name. The people that went after me only did so because I called
              them out for being lolicons and they felt threatened because of
              it. It's ridiculous how people EVER believed their baseless
              accusations to begin with, which are either edited images,
              manipulated messages, or things taken wildly out of context,
              especially with the fact that they doxxed me and constantly made
              transphobic remarks about me. Everyone that has known me for the
              past few years can vouch for me, and it is disgusting and
              sickening the lengths these losers have gone to witch hunt me, or
              worse yet go after my friends or slander their reputations for
              standing by my side.
            </p>
            <p>
              I will never give up on defending myself online, because it is
              never wrong to go after sick bastards who sexualize children. My
              only mistake was not going after them sooner.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what my friends have to say about me if my word alone is
              not enough:

              I met Jade in Romania this summer, and we had lots of time to
              connect and learn a lot about each other. I know her well enough
              to say that Jade is honestly one of the kindest people I ever met.
              She would never hurt anyone, and she's always there to help when
              you need her. It is heart breaking, and sickening how much pain
              some losers are willing to cause to such a dear friend. Despite
              not always making it clear, I have stood by her since the very
              beginning, and I will keep doing so until the end. She should be
              allowed back to any server that with good intentions made a bad
              call to ban her. We all make mistakes, server owners too.
              <br /><br />
              Everyone who knows better and has a good heart will know I am
              right. Have I ever sided with bad people on ANY occasion? No, so
              what makes you think this situation is any different? Justice is
              on our side, it is only a matter of time before people learn the
              truth.

              I have been close friends with Jade for a while, and I was
              saddened about all the drama that has been going on since last
              year. The constant misinformation and demonization of a person who
              has done nothing wrong is absolutely vile. A lot of things (most
              of which were transphobia-fueled) about her were either taken out
              of context or have been completely fabricated just because she
              called out a person harassing her for pedophilia. Yet despite all
              the evidence that shows Jade as the better person on the whole
              side of the drama, a lot of people I have talked to decided to
              take the opposite side of the discussion and treat it like gospel.
              <br /><br />
              When this drama happened, I sat in confusion as a lot of people I
              knew suddenly started to slander one of my closest friends. The
              weird part though is, the more I delved into the drama the more I
              realized how screwed up the whole situation is and how everyone
              believed that it was real instantly. No one truly tried to look
              into the situation further than what has been sent by a group of
              individuals who have in the recent time done nothing but harass a
              person.
              <br /><br />
              If this changes your mind about me, so be it. I can't handle my
              friend (who mind you, if anything, has changed a lot since the
              incident) being harassed for something that she doesn't deserve at
              the degree that she gets harassed right now. We are all humans, we
              make mistakes, what truly matters though, is growing out of them
              and understanding the scope of the actions that have happened.
              Yes, not everyone will be okay with that, but that's completely
              normal.

              I've known Jade for quite some time now. We first met on a private
              server, but we grew closer when I joined the raytek Discord server
              around winter, actually, just a day before Christmas of 2023. Jade
              has always been kind to me. Sure, there were some dramas on the
              server, but in all honesty, most of that was due to my own
              misunderstandings rather than any serious issues.
              <br /><br />
              From my experience, Jade is one of the nicest people in the
              community. I genuinely don't understand the drama surrounding her.
              I truly believe Jade is a good person. I know saying this might
              get me “cancelled” in some servers, but if it does, I won't regret
              it. People need to understand the truth: Jade isn't the villain
              she's being made out to be, and it's unfair that she's being
              banned from so many servers because of it.
            </p>
            <h4>Anonymous:</h4>
            <p class="quote">
              I've known Jade for 5 years at this point, we met on the XP
              discord server when she was going by a different name and loved
              car PFPs, and we hopped on other servers around the Windows
              community too. I've helped her learn to make websites and even
              hosted some files on my server for her project.
              <br /><br />
              I haven't been connected online as much since university and work,
              but I've gotten a few chances to meet with Jade IRL since she went
              to university, and we spent more time face-to-face. I noticed her
              condition degraded, she looked physically and mentally tired, and
              she eventually told me all about the drama. I've been trying to
              stay out of online drama since I don't have that much time to stay
              on Discord anymore. Hearing people online say stuff is one thing,
              but seeing a person hurt in front of you is different. I can truly
              say that she's a good person and means no harm, she's fighting
              through a lot of hard things in her life, with both family, health
              and education, especially since we're from countries that don't
              treat people like us that nicely. It's easy to accuse people of
              nasty things, and even easier to fake evidence online, but it's
              hard to realise that behind the other screen there's another
              person with feelings, wishes and struggles.

              In addition to my friends' statements, we got tremendous support
              from the rest of the raytek server members who also decided to
              stay anonymous, and their help is greatly appreciated.
