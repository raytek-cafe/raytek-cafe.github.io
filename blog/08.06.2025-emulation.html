            <h3>the beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              Ever since I was a little kid I've been particularly interested in
              game consoles. Growing up I only had a pretty low end desktop PC
              so the idea of games that were only available on other platforms
              was quite enigmatic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Around 2016 I discovered that some console games can in fact be
              played on Windows. Back then I was really into Sonic games so I'd
              play around with a Sega Genesis emulator called Fusion and run
              different community-made mods of Sonic Games (called ROM hacks).
              Many of them were of very high quality, with user-created levels,
              characters, sometimes even entire stories, which provided me with
              hours of fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first question that came into my mind was, "how did they
              manage to make an entire console work on a Windows computer?". The
              idea that someone managed to make games for an entirely different
              device run on my ordinary PC seemed completely alien to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wasn't far from the truth because, to the average person,
              emulation may as well be magic. It is very difficult as it
              requires deep knowledge of the original hardware and hundreds of
              hours of reverse engineering. Even for a console seemingly as
              simple as the Genesis, the developers had to study the original
              firmware and emulate the entire Motorola CPU, Yamaha sound chip
              and the rest of the components which, needless to say, requires a
              lot of programming skill.

            <h3>PS2 emulation with PCSX2</h3>
            <p>
              As I grew older my interest in other devices deepened, and so I
              tried emulating PlayStation 2 games out of curiosity. Even though
              my CPU wasn't quite powerful enough to run the PS2 version of Need
              for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, I was impressed at just how different it
              was from the PC version I played as a kid. The PS2 version was the
              first game to be developed by EA BlackBox, notorious and cherished
              for the staples of the series such as Underground, Most Wanted and
              Carbon, so many players would agree that it is the superior way to
              play it, given it has nicer graphics, car models and better
              opponent and police AI.
            </p>
            <img
              class="image"
              src="img/emulation/pcsx2.jpg"
              style="position: relative; float: right; z-index: 1"
            />
            <p>
              The software that made this possible is an emulator called PCSX2,
              the developers of which have made collosal progress in the last
              few years. Last time I played NFS Hot Pursuit 2, it still had some
              noticeable bugs that have all been fixed by now. It let me play
              other PlayStation 2 exclusives, such as Gran Turismo 4 and Burnout
              3: Takedown which became some of my favorite racing games.
            </p>
            <p>
              A huge part of what makes emulation so great is that it lets you
              play your favorite console games with modern enhancements, such as
              higher resolutions, widescreen and 60FPS patches, even online play
              for games that were originally splitscreen. It also enables
              software and hardware preservation as retro consoles get scarce
              and extremely overpriced, and disc games are subject to decay and
              become difficult to obtain. Unfortunately, some companies such as
              Nintendo fight emulation and game preservation with all their
              force while shamelessly using it for their own products (notably
              the NES Classic Edition) and not providing an alternative way to
              play their delisted games. This makes things difficult for gamers
              who simply want to enjoy their childhood titles.

            <h3>PS3 emulation with RPCS3</h3>
            <p>
              Delving into Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2 and realizing just how
              interesting the game is, especially with the aspect of collecting
              historical cars that aren't quite available in arcade racers like
              Need for Speed, I quickly became infatuated with the series and
              wanted to try the later titles. While GT4 is considered the best
              game in the series, I was curious about the graphics and gameplay
              enhancements offered by the sheer computing power of the
              PlayStation 3.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was when I realized 7th generation console emulation is still
              not quite perfect. While many games are perfectly playable, most
              will have notable bugs and imperfections, and the processing power
              required to emulate the PS3 makes it not so accessible to
              everybody. Nevertheless I enjoyed playing Gran Turismo 5 and liked
              it so much that I even bought a real PS3 to play GT6 which doesn't
              run too well in the emulator. I was pretty happy with my purchase
              as there are many upsides to owning a modded PS3.

            <h3>PC emulation with 86Box</h3>
            <p float="left">
              While console emulation in itself is amazing, what completely blew
              my mind was the ability to emulate PC's from the 80's and 90's,
              starting with the original IBM PC and ending with the Pentium II.
              Being a huge retro Windows nerd, that made me incredibly curious
              and so I tried out 86Box by installing Windows 98SE in an emulated
              Pentium 166 MHz box with a 3dfx Voodoo II and a Sound Blaster
              AWE32.
            </p>
            <p>
              Continuing with the idea of software and hardware preservation,
              86Box allows you to run ancient software designed for Windows 9x
              and DOS that simply doesn't run on modern Windows anymore and
              saves you the hassle of having to dig up an old breaking down
              Pentium III CPU, motherboard, RAM, IDE hard drive, graphics card
              and all the other stuff required to run an old OS. While virtual
              machine software like VMware does run Windows 9x, it does so
              without graphics capability and you may sometimes run into CPU
              speed issues. Meanwhile, 86Box emulates an entire era-appropriate
              PC, allowing old games and specific software to run properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even more amazingly, 86Box is not limited to just Windows, because
              it emulates the hardware, not the software. One of my greatest
              feats was managing to install the latest version of Gentoo Linux
              on a Pentium 166 MHz, complete with networking, sound and a
              graphical interface. This is possible thanks to the fact that
              Gentoo is a source distribution, which means you have to compile
              all the code manually for your machine. This took many nights of
              configuring and falling asleep to my PC's fans going full speed,
              but I think the end result was well worth it.
            </p>

            <h3>conclusions</h3>
            <p>
              In conclusion, emulation is truly an amazing feat that should not
              be taken for granted. While it can be used for playing games that
              you don't legally own, it is an extremely important part of
              preserving software and hardware history, that would be greatly
              affected without it. We encourage you to only emulate devices and
              games that you own and dump your own firmware should the emulator
              require it. And of course, if you enjoyed the software, make sure
              to support the developers with a coffee. There are many projects
              that haven't been mentioned in this post, such as the Wii and
              GameCube emulator Dolphin, and QEMU which allows you to emulate
              many different PC architectures including ARM. There are also many
              other awesome projects, so be sure to check them out.
