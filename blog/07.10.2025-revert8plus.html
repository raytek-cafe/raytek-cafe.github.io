            <h3>before I start...</h3>
            <p>
              This is <b>not</b> an attack against Teknix or his project (nor
              was it made because his transformation pack is more popular than
              mine). He has done incredible things, and it is insane what he has
              accomplished with Revert8Plus.
              <b
                >I even suggest helping him financially if you can
                <a href="https://teknixstuff.com/Network/Donate/">here</a></b
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              But despite the incredible work put into it, Revert8Plus has
              caused problems for
              <a
                href="https://github.com/raytek-cafe/Okaeri-Legacy/wiki/Okaeri-is-broken-on-Revert8Plus!"
                >developers</a
              >
              and its users.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <img
              class="image"
              src="img/re8pl/ffbroke.png"
              style="position: relative; float: right; z-index: 1"
            />
            <h3>the growing issues</h3>
            <p>
              Revert8Plus V4 was never finished software (build 1137 is the last
              build that was marked as the 'latest', while the rest were marked
              as 'pre-release'), and with that, certain features were left
              unfinished or broken (e.g. logon screen issues, display settings
              refusing to launch, or the 'Custom' button in the installer not
              working due to not being finished in time for the deadline).
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a pretty small issue, right? Not quite. With unfinished
              software, you have buggy code, and the buggy code in question
              (Registry Redirect) would cause things to break for the user
              (Firefox forks being the main focus). Those same users would blame
              those forks instead of Revert8Plus due to the mentality that
              "transformation Packs only modify how Windows looks, so it must be
              the fork's fault."
            </p>
            <hr />
            <img
              class="image"
              src="img/re8pl/blackscreen.png"
              style="position: relative; float: right; z-index: 1"
            />
            <h3>use old tweaking software, lose your OS!</h3>
            <p>
              <i>"B-but... it works fine on my machine!™"</i>
            </p>
            <p>
              The fact that you can get a working install at all is impressive.
              Why so? Well, Revert8Plus's last update was in February 2025, when
              the latest versions of OpenGlass & Legacy were 1.3 and 1.4 (for
              clarification, as of writing this, the OpenGlass Standard repo was
              archived, and Legacy is at version 2.4.1.2083).
            </p>
            <p>
              A lot has changed since then, mainly Microsoft altering how some
              things are handled inside DWM. With this, ALTaleX531 had to make
              an announcement about dropping support for 24H2 for the time being
              and fixing it later. Revert8Plus users were not aware of this,
              which left many of them playing a game of luck with DWM and
              whether they could use their PC or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              And, of course, this issue is still present to this day on the
              latest Revert8Plus build as of me writing this blog article.
            </p>
            <p>
              With each passing month, the number of issues increases thanks to
              monthly updates changing how things work internally, while the
              tools used in Revert8Plus become older and more outdated by the
              day.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <h3>...the solution?</h3>
            <p>
              Sadly, there is no perfect solution if you want something that
              does everything for you automatically and claims to survive
              updates (not even my 21H2to7 Transformation Pack is
              immune to Microsoft screwing things up).
            </p>
            <p>
              But luckily, the "do it yourself" method always exists, and if you
              do not care about having your OS slightly inaccurate (which if you
              were using Revert8Plus, you didn't care about that), you could get
              what Revert8Plus offered and more!
            </p>

            <h3>so how do I DIY my own 10/11to7?</h3>
            <p>
              As making a guide to create a complete 10to7 or 11to7 would get
              outdated pretty quickly, I'm only going to give the basic advice
              on getting a basic *to7 running.
            </p>
            <p>
              To start, you need the following software, which Revert8Plus uses
              most of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                StartIsBack++ / StartAllBack / explorer7 (for the Windows 7
                taskbar/start menu look and feel)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you only want the glass look of Windows 7 but not the frames or
              the rest, you can just download and install
              <a href="https://github.com/ALTaleX531/OpenGlass">OpenGlass</a>
              and use this
              <a href="resources\re8pl\oglbasic.reg">registry file</a> for a
              glassy Aero-like title bar (<b>Note:</b> it will import items in
              <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> in the registry).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wanna go crazy with it, you could install
              <a href="https://windhawk.net/">Windhawk</a> and the Accent Color
              Sync mod to have more color customization.
            </p>
            <p>
              But if you want to go further, you would need to install
              <a href="https://github.com/namazso/SecureUxTheme/releases"
                >SecureUxTheme</a
              >
              or any other alternative, as Microsoft does not allow you to use
              third-party themes by default.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you've installed SecureUxTheme, you need to copy the
              Aero10/11 theme into
              <code>%systemroot%\Resources\Themes</code> and then run the .theme
              file, which will greet you with a weird Windows 7 look. This can
              be fixed by adding the DWORD <code>"CaptionButtons"</code> in
              <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm</code>
              or
              <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Dwm</code>
              and setting the value to <code>2</code>. If you want everything
              done, you can import
              <a href="resources\re8pl\oglfull.reg">this registry file</a>
              (<b>Note:</b> it will import items in
              <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> in the registry). After logging
              out and back in, you will have your Windows almost look like
              Windows 7.

            <h3>conclusions</h3>
            <p>
              In conclusion, software like Revert8Plus or 21H2to7, no matter how
              great they can be, will always carry the risk of damaging your OS.
              This risk arises when Microsoft inevitably updates one of the core
              components in Windows, potentially causing the tweaking tools to
              suddenly break. In the case of Revert8Plus, this has already
              happened, and since Teknix is currently focused on V5, this flaw
              will only get fixed when V5 is released.

              In the other hand, doing things yourself might seem difficult, but
              once you get it set up, it becomes easier and provides more
              customization options, including custom themes, custom icons, and
              much more, as shown in these examples:
