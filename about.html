          <p>
            Tired of the same new AI-infested, corporate-controlled, soulless
            tech that makes up today's world? We feel you.

            raytek is a group of friends who, being unhappy with the current
            state of the tech world, attempt to change the landscape into what
            it used to be - computers that work for the user, not the other way
            around.
          </p>

            This website is a collection of our work and knowledge, ranging from
            simple scripts and tweaks to entire software backports and DIY
            projects. Additionally, we have a blog where we share our thoughts
            on different topics related to hardware, software, gaming and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since reviving old tech is one of our main goals, this site is
            compatible with older browsers and systems, the baseline being New
            Moon on Windows XP. In the future, we plan to add a compatibility
            stylesheet for IE8 and RetroZilla, so that even your toaster can
            open this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you may have noticed, the design of this website is very
            reminiscent of old skeuomorphic interfaces - using smooth shadows,
            glow effects and gradients, we wanted to bring back that sense of
            depth and realism that many modern designs have abandoned in favor
            of a more minimalistic approach. We believe that this design choice
            enhances the user experience, making it more engaging and visually
            appealing.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope our projects prove useful and inspiring for the tech
            community. We welcome contributions and suggestions, so if you have
            any ideas or feedback, feel free to reach out to us via GitHub.
